# Aidanish Language
Aidanish is my own conlang made just for fun.
All entries are spanish-based, that means all of them are a translation to a spanish word, so you will see `hola -> hai` instead of `hello -> hai`

Running `all.py` will put all entries from all text files on lexicon/types into lexicon/all.txt.

Running `words.py` will put all the aidanish words from all text files on lexicon/types into words.py without repeating.

Running `main.py` is a shortcut to run all the previously mentioned of python files.

Running `stats.py` will show the stats for the language, you must run `main.py` previously to these stats to be correct if you have modified something before.

Running `keys.py` will show you a list of 3 letter keys that can be used for word games in the language. You can put a number argument to set the amount of words that must fulfill the keys to be displayed. Defaults to 20.

The script `parse.py` is used by the previous scripts and must not be used on their own

**Lets make a poem:**

*Roixait sei roxo*<br>
*Violetit sei anil*<br>
*Fliaga sei ganai*<br>
*Baba sei zu*<br>

## Contribute
I don't think I'm accepting pull requests in general for this project, if for some reason people start using this language I'll consider into adding some town speak :)
