**Aidanish** is my own conlang that I made just for fun. A mixture between romanic, germanic and other languages, with a bunch of my own imagination and perversion. 

All entries are spanish-based, that means all of them are a translation to a spanish word, so you will see `hola → hai` instead of `hello → hai`

## Glossary of files
* Running `all.py` will put all entries from all text files on `lexicon/types` into `lexicon/all.txt`.
* Running `words.py` will put all the aidanish words from all text files on `lexicon/types` into `words.txt` without repeating.
* Running `main.py` is a shortcut to run all the previously mentioned of python files.
* Running `stats.py` will show the stats for the language, you must run `main.py` previously to these stats to be correct if you have modified something before.
* Running `keys.py` will show you a list of 3 letter keys that can be used for word games in the language. You can put a number argument to set the amount of words that must fulfill the keys to be displayed. Defaults to 20.
* Running `genders.py` will put all entries with their correct gender into `lexicon/genders.txt`.
* Running `jsondict.py` will create a dictionary in a json format.

The script `parse.py` is used by the previous scripts and must not be used on their own

## Contribute
I don't think I'm accepting pull requests in general for this project, if for some reason people start using this language I'll consider into adding some town speak :)<br>
