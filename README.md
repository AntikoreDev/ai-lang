**Aidanish** is my own conlang that I made just for fun. A mixture between romanic, germanic and other languages, with a bunch of my own imagination and perversion. 

All entries are spanish-based, that means all of them are a translation to a spanish word, so you will see `hola → hai` instead of `hello → hai`

## Language Basics
A few sentences that you can easily use in normal speech

- Hai, com zu astei? → _Hello. How are you?_
- Na loi zer → _I love you_
- Naito grazei → _Thank you_
- Non lanai → _Your welcome_
- Na taine 18 yarit → _I am 18 years old_
- Na sei John → _I am John_
- Donde zu vivai? → _Where do you live?_
- Na vivai en Espanna → _I live in Spain_
- Diskaire → _I'm sorry_
- Non lanaiet → _Don't worry_
- La tempera astei aito nauhen → _The temperatura is warm today_

### Some interesting quotes
**These ain't literal translations** but adaptations so they mean the same, or they just resemble to a real quote

"Beiet perso am tentaoro e so izkribeie, beiet homo e so expreseie"
_Give a pen to a man and they will write, give it to a human and they will express_

"Morto en pluva argaie eir"
_May death rain upon them_

"Loi paz e ordo"
_Love, peace and order_

"Aer paire, lude noi"
_When the air speaks, the group is quiet_

"Air aidanakia, imperia magna"
_Long live Aidanace, great empire_

"Inferno rata tendai koi baine intentio"
_Road to hell is paved with good intentions_

## Glossary of files
* Running `all.py` will put all entries from all text files on `lexicon/types` into `lexicon/all.txt`.
* Running `words.py` will put all the aidanish words from all text files on `lexicon/types` into `words.txt` without repeating.
* Running `main.py` is a shortcut to run all the previously mentioned of python files.
* Running `stats.py` will show the stats for the language, you must run `main.py` previously to these stats to be correct if you have modified something before.
* Running `keys.py` will show you a list of 3 letter keys that can be used for word games in the language. You can put a number argument to set the amount of words that must fulfill the keys to be displayed. Defaults to 20.
* Running `genders.py` will put all entries with their correct gender into `lexicon/genders.txt`.
* Running `jsondict.py` will create a dictionary in a json format.

The script `parse.py` is used by the previous scripts and must not be used on their own

I don't think I'm accepting pull requests in general for this project, if for some reason people start using this language I'll consider into adding some town speak :)<br>
